Task Level (Beginner):

Visualization Library Documentation
Objective: Create a comprehensive documentation guide for 2
of the following Python visualization libraries: Matplotlib,
Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, and Pandas. Your guide should focus on
the variety of graphs each library can generate and include
practical examples with code snippets.

Requirements:
1. Library Overview: Provide a brief introduction to the selected
libraries, highlighting their unique features and typical use cases.
2. Graph Types:
- Document the different types of graphs available in each
library, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms,
pie charts, etc.
- For each graph type, include a brief description, potential use
case, and a simple code example demonstrating how to generate
the graph.
3. Comparison: Offer a comparison section discussing the
strengths and weaknesses of each library regarding ease of use,
customization options, interactivity, and performance with large
datasets.
